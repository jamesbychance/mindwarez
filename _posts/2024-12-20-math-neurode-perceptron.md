Rosenblatt's neurode the first artificial neuron drawing inspriation from the biological neuron and a node (the data structure).<br><br>
The Mark 1 Perceptron added a bias and introduced weights to the inputs of the neurode, enabling the ability for the perceptron to learn. <br><br>
The perceptron was the first classifier that could learn and find the boundry (classification) between two groups. Defining the boundary is easy for the human-in-the-loop to conceptualise at the 2D or even the planar boundary at the 3D level, but what about the nth-D? the hyperboundary is not so easy to conceptualise. however, the perceptron is able to identify the optimal boundary regardless of the number of dimesions. it just works!
